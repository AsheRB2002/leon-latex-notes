## Info 
Any theorem number is the closest theorem to the lecture notes (some are taken from other sources)

If you want to import into overleaf or anything, you will need `preamble.sty` and either `thmboxes_col.sty` or `thmboxes_white.sty` as well as the main `.tex` file

Included is a `template.tex` file if you want to start from scratch for another course :)

Dependencies that are not in a barebones TinyTeX installation are listed in the dependencies file, if you are using Overleaf / a larger TeX package they should be preinstalled already

If someone knows which package extarticle is included in then lmk :sob:, right now it's just sitting in the folder lol
